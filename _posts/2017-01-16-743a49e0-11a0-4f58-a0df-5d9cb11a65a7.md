## Sustainability

With over 10 years in the Sri Lankan landscape industry, it is our responsibility to preserve our natural resources. As a result, we have focused our efforts on lowering our impact on the environment by giving companies the opportunity for additional sustainable options like organic plant healthcare, use of beneficial insects, rain water collection, low flow irrigation systems and the incorporation of native plant species in the landscape. 7-Green are completely committed to the preservation of Sri Lanka's environment as our work with The Green Forest Association demonstrates.
