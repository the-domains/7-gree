  My life has been a love affair with Sri Lanka's wildlife, flora and fauna. I
  grow every indigenous Sri Lankan plant in my own nursery. I have written
  numerous book on the plants and animals that inhabit this beautiful island, I
  lecture in 300 schools every year on environmental preservation and
  appreciation. 7-Green is my company and it reflects my values and commitment
  and over the last 10 years we have been involved in some amazing projects,
  from major commercial installations to small private gardens on a tight budget
  and have loved them all. I would love to help you with your project big or
  small. Contact us and we can see if we can create something simply beautiful
  together.
