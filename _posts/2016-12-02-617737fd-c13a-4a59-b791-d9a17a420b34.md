  My life has been a love affair with Sri Lankas flora and fauna. I grow every
  indigenous plant in my own nursery. I have written numerous book on the plants
  and animals that inhabit this beautiful island, I lecture in 300 schools every
  year on environmental preservation and appreciation. 7-Green is my company and
  over the last 10 years we have been involved in some amazing projects from
  major commercial installations to small private gardens on a tight budget and
  have loved them all. I would love to help you with your project big or small.
  Contact us and we can see if we can create something together.
