  My life has been a love affair with Sri Lanka's wildlife, flora and fauna. At
  7 Green grow every indigenous Sri Lankan plant in our own organic nursery. I
  have written numerous book on the plants and animals that inhabit this
  beautiful island, I lecture in 300 schools every year on environmental
  preservation and appreciation. 7-Green is my company and it reflects my values
  and commitment to improving Sri Lanka's environment and through intelligent
  and sustainable planting. Over the last 10 years we have been involved in some
  amazing projects, from major commercial installations to small private gardens
  on a tight budget and have loved them all. I would love to help you with your
  project big or small. Contact us and we can see if we can create something
  simply beautiful together.

My life has been a love affair with Sri Lanka's wildlife, flora and fauna. At 7 Green grow every indigenous Sri Lankan plant in our own organic nursery. I have written numerous book on the plants and animals that inhabit this beautiful island, I lecture in 300 schools every year on environmental preservation and appreciation. 7-Green is my company and it reflects my values and commitment to improving Sri Lanka's environment and through intelligent and sustainable planting. Over the last 10 years we have been involved in some amazing projects, from major commercial installations to small private gardens on a tight budget and have loved them all. I would love to help you with your project big or small. Contact us and we can see if we can create something simply beautiful together.
